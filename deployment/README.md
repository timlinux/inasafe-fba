# Deployment guide

## Local development

This section will cover how to deploy for local development.
All referred location is relative to this working directory unless specified otherwise.

## Checkout the source code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:inasafe/inasafe-fba.git
cd inasafe-fba
cd deployment
```



## Backend setup

The backend is two part, postgrest and geoserver.
To refer to postgrest customization, refer to [Docker OSM Readme](../docker-osm/indonesia-buildings/README.md)

GeoServer setup documentation is not yet ready.

Once you finished making setup, run backend instance using:

```bash
make backend-up
```

And to shut it down, run

```bash
make backend-down
```

## Frontend with local backend

To make your frontend target your local backend, simply change your `.env` file to target local backend connections.
Default docker-compose settings will target the default port opened by default backend settings.
You just need to make hostname entry for each server backend which is:
`postgres.fbf.test` (for REST API), `swagger.fbf.test` (for REST API schema view), `geoserver.fbf.test` (for GeoServer mapping backend)
 
To run the instance, this time run the frontend and backend

```
make up backend-up
```

To shutdown

```
make down backend-down
```




## Frontend only (for use with remote backend)

The frontend uses postgrest backend and geoserver backend.
So we need to tell the conf file where the backend is.
It is generally recommended to use domain name to refer server whenever possible.
This will make it less resistance/less error-prone to deploy it to cloud server.

To associate certain domain name into an IP address, refer this [FAQ](FAQ.md#how-can-i-create-local-hosts-name).

Copy `.sample.env` as `.env` file.

```bash
cp .sample.env .env
```


Edit `.env` file and change corresponding `_SERVER` and `_BASE_URL` value.
By default, if you want to setup full test server in your local machine, all `*.fbf.test` subdomain should refer to your local machine's IP Address.

If you just want to develop frontend only against staging backend, use staging server address.
To make it easier, copy `.sample.staging.env` as `.env` file.

Once that is done, execute

```
make build
```

If you only needed to change frontend code in `frontend` folder from the root of the repo, then you don't need to rebuild everytime you change code.
You can mount your frontend code into the container. Copy `docker-compose.override.local-volumes.yml` and paste it as `docker-compose.override.yml`.
You can also override docker-compose file in `docker-compose.override.yml` if you wish.

Once preparation is done, run your instance using:

```
make up
```

This is needed to make sure your frontend target the correct backend as specified before.

When you are done, do this to cleanup/shutdown

```
make down
```
